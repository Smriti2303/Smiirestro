        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <br>
        <div id="history-content">
            <p>Founded in 2015, PARTHRESTRO was built on the love of food and community. Our founder, Chef Parth, wanted to create a space where people could enjoy innovative cuisine in a warm and inviting atmosphere.</p>

        <br>
        <div id="extended-history" style="display: none;">
            <p>Since then, we have grown into a landmark in the city, known for our creative dishes and excellent service. From seasonal ingredients to specialty cocktails, we always strive to offer something new and exciting.</p>
            <p>PARTHRESTRO began as a dream shared by Chef Parth and his close-knit team of culinary enthusiasts. What started as a small pop-up kitchen in 2015 quickly grew into a full-fledged restaurant with a distinct identity. Our vision was to create a place where people could enjoy innovative cuisine without the pretension often associated with fine dining.

                In our early days, we traveled across the country, exploring different food cultures and sourcing unique ingredients. This journey inspired our menu, which reflects a fusion of global flavors with a local touch. Our commitment to using fresh, seasonal produce not only ensures high-quality dishes but also supports local farmers and reduces our carbon footprint.
                
                As we grew, our focus on sustainability and community engagement became a cornerstone of our ethos. We implemented waste reduction practices and launched programs to support local charities and food banks. Our "Give Back Nights" offer a portion of our proceeds to these community causes, reinforcing our commitment to making a positive impact beyond our kitchen.
                
                Today, PARTHRESTRO has become a landmark in the city, known for its creative dishes, exceptional service, and welcoming atmosphere. Whether you're here for a romantic dinner, a family celebration, or a casual lunch, we aim to make every visit memorable.</p>

        <ul>

            <br>
            <li>Community Engagement: We believe in giving back to the community that has supported us from the start.

These events not only strengthen our community ties but also create lasting memories.</li>
